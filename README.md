##  What Is AuthentiCred?

AuthentiCred is an open source platform that makes it **easy**, **fast**, and **secure** to issue, store, and verify academic documents degrees, certificates, training records, and letters of recommendation. Built on **blockchain** technology and W3C **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)**, 

## Statement Problem

Today, proving your hard-earned school or job qualifications is a frustrating and inefficient ordeal. Employers face a slow, costly verification process, often resorting to individual calls or emails to each institution to confirm degrees. This outdated system makes it easy for forged paper and diplomas to slip through the cracks, undermining trust and leading to unqualified hires.
Adding to the chaos, every college and training center operates on different, incompatible systems. This forces students to juggle multiple transcripts and spend valuable time and money repeatedly just to apply for jobs or further education. Even worse, your most sensitive personal qualification data is frequently stored by third parties, leaving it vulnerable and completely out of your control.AuthentiCred revolutionizes this broken system. We empower educational institutions to issue tamper-proof digital certificates on a secure, decentralized network. Students gain a single, intuitive digital wallet to securely store all their academic and professional records. With AuthentiCred, anyone can verify credentials in seconds, without the need to share sensitive personal details.


AuthentiCred empowers:

- **Institutions** (schools, universities, training centers) to issue tamper-proof digital credentials.  
- **Learners** (students, professionals) to collect all their records in a personal digital wallet.  
- **Verifiers** (employers, scholarship programs, immigration services) to confirm authenticity in seconds.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Issuance**  
   - An accredited institution creates and digitally signs a Verifiable Credential (VC).  
   - The VC’s cryptographic “fingerprint” is anchored on a permissioned blockchain.

2. **Storage**  
   - Learners receive their VCs in a secure, self-sovereign **digital wallet** (mobile or web).  
   - No personal data is stored on-chain—only immutable proofs.

3. **Verification**  
   - A verifier scans a QR code or clicks a secure link.  
   - The blockchain confirms the signature and validity in **seconds**—no calls or emails needed.
