## Statement Problem

Today, proving your hard-earned school or job qualifications is a frustrating and inefficient ordeal. Employers face a slow, costly verification process, often resorting to individual calls or emails to each institution to confirm degrees(when needed). This outdated system makes it easy for forged paper and diplomas to slip through the cracks, undermining trust and leading to unqualified hires.
Adding to the chaos, every college and training center operates on different, incompatible systems. This forces students to juggle multiple transcripts and spend valuable time and money repeatedly just to apply for jobs or further education. Even worse, your most sensitive personal qualification data is frequently stored by third parties, leaving it vulnerable and completely out of your control.AuthentiCred revolutionizes this broken system. We empower educational institutions to issue tamper-proof digital certificates on a secure, decentralized network. Students gain a single, intuitive digital wallet to securely store all their academic and professional records. With AuthentiCred, anyone can verify credentials in seconds, without the need to share sensitive personal details.
