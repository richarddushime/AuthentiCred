## **OVERVIEW**

AuthentiCred is a **Django-based web application** that implements a **decentralized credential verification system** using blockchain technology and W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs). The system consists of four main Django apps:

### **Core Apps:**
1. **`users`** - User management and authentication
2. **`blockchain`** - Smart contract interactions and blockchain operations
3. **`credentials`** - Credential issuance, management, and verification
4. **`wallets`** - Digital wallet functionality for credential storage

## **PURPOSE & PROBLEM STATEMENT**

**Problem:** Traditional credential verification is slow, insecure, and fragmented:
- Days to verify credentials vs. seconds
- Paper records easily forged vs. blockchain-anchored tamper-proof records
- Country-specific processes vs. global interoperability
- Institutions control user data vs. user-controlled data
- Multiple transcripts needed vs. one lifelong wallet

**Solution:** AuthentiCred provides:
- **Instant verification** through blockchain anchoring
- **Tamper-proof credentials** using cryptographic signatures
- **Global interoperability** through W3C standards
- **User sovereignty** over personal data
- **Unified credential storage** in digital wallets

## **ðŸ‘¥ USER TYPES & ROLES**

The system supports three distinct user types:

1. **STUDENT (Credential Holder)**
   - Receives and stores credentials in digital wallet
   - Shares credentials via QR codes or secure links
   - Controls what data to share with verifiers

2. **INSTITUTION (Credential Issuer)**
   - Creates credential schemas and templates
   - Issues digitally signed verifiable credentials
   - Registers DIDs on blockchain for trust verification
   - Can revoke credentials when necessary

3. **EMPLOYER (Credential Verifier)**
   - Verifies credential authenticity instantly
   - Scans QR codes or uses verification portal
   - No need to contact institutions directly

## **BLOCKCHAIN INTEGRATION**

### **Smart Contracts (Solidity):**

1. **`DIDRegistry.sol`**
   - Maps DIDs to public keys
   - Enables decentralized identity resolution
   - Stores institution identities

2. **`TrustRegistry.sol`**
   - Manages trusted issuer status
   - Controls which institutions can issue valid credentials
   - Enables trust verification

3. **`CredentialAnchor.sol`**
   - Anchors credential hashes to blockchain
   - Provides immutable proof of credential existence
   - Enables instant verification

4. **`RevocationRegistry.sol`**
   - Tracks revoked credentials
   - Prevents use of invalid credentials
   - Maintains credential lifecycle

### **Blockchain Network:**
- **Development:** Ganache (localhost:7545)
- **Production:** Supports Polygon, Besu(ongoing)
- **Chain ID:** 1337 (Ganache default)

## **CRYPTOGRAPHIC SECURITY**

### **Key Management:**
- **SECP256k1** elliptic curve cryptography
- **Ed25519** for DID operations
- **Encrypted storage** of private keys using Django encrypted fields
- **Key derivation** from private keys for public key generation

### **Credential Signing:**
- **ECDSA signatures** with SHA-256 hashing
- **JSON-LD canonicalization** for consistent signing
- **JWS (JSON Web Signatures)** format for proofs
- **Verifiable Credential** standard compliance

## **DATA MODELS**

    â”œâ”€â”€ name, description, website
    â”œâ”€â”€ accreditation_proof
    â””â”€â”€ is_trusted (blockchain verified)
```

### **Credential System:**
```python
CredentialSchema

â”œâ”€â”€ issuer, holder (Users)
â”œâ”€â”€ schema (CredentialSchema)
â”œâ”€â”€ status (DRAFT/ISSUED/REVOKED/EXPIRED)
â””â”€â”€ vc_hash (SHA-256 of credential)
```

### **Wallet System:**
```python
Wallet
â”œâ”€â”€ user (OneToOne)
â”œâ”€â”€ private_key (Encrypted)
â””â”€â”€ wallet_credentials (ManyToMany)

WalletCredential
â”œâ”€â”€ wallet, credential
â””â”€â”€ is_archived (Boolean)
```

### **Blockchain Tracking:**
```python
OnChainTransaction
â”œâ”€â”€ tx_hash, status, transaction_type
â”œâ”€â”€ metadata (JSON)
â””â”€â”€ block_number

DIDRegistration
â”œâ”€â”€ did, public_key
